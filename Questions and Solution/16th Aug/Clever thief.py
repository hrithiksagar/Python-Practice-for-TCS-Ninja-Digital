# There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbors left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value?
# Examples:
# Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
# Output: 19
# Explanation: The thief will steal
# 6, 1, 8 and 4 from the house.
# Input: hval[] = {5, 3, 4, 11, 2}
# Output: 16
# Explanation: Thief will steal5 and 11

approach:
sol = find max sum subsequence where no 2 selected elemnest are adj.
approach is recursive
case:
1. if ele is selected then next ele cannot be selected
2. if ele is not selected then next ele can be seleced
// sol
1. create extra space dp, dp = array to store sub problems
2.
if len of array is 0, print 0
if len of array is 1, print 1st ele.
if len is 2, print max of those 2 elem
3. update dp[0] as array[0] and dp[1] as max of 2 ele
4. traverse array form 2nd ele i.e. 2nd index to end
5. for every index, update dp[i] as max dp[i-2]+arrau[0] and dp[i-1]
this defines 2 cases:
if ele is selected then previous ele cant selected.
if ele not selected then porevious ele can be selected
6. print dp[n-10
